What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When I initialize a repository git creates a hidden directory to track the files of the work.
    
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    In the working directory lives the files of the project, work, etc.
    In the repository lives the files that have already commited.
    In the staging area are the cache of the files to be commited.
