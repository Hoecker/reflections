When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I'm working with other people or when I update my repositories from different machines and it needed to be synchronized. Or in general to make a backup of an entire project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Changes in remote repository may coflict with changes in the local repository.
    So... don't worry, drink a lot of alcohol and look for a party!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    When we fork a repository on Github to my account, it clone and reference the original repository.
    Cloning a repository is equal to copy the whole thing and includes the history of commits and all versions of the files.
    Branches are for test new features from a specific commit without affect the master branch or do not desired modifications.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    To work offline with an actualized copy of the repository.
