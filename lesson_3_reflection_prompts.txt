When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I'm working with other people or when I update my repositories from different machines and it needed to be synchronized. Or in general to make a backup of an entire project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Changes in remote repository may coflict with changes in the local repository.
    So... don't worry, drink a lot of alcohol and look for a party!
